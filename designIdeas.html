    <p>At the beginning, we chose this background and designed our website based on the theme of the background. <br>
       What I Made: <br>
       <ul>
       <li>Chose the colors from the component colors of the theme, which are red and dark blue. </li>
       <li>Picked the gradient colors.
       <li>Picked the border images and edited them to make them fit the boxes. </li>
       <li>Designed the layouts of "boxes" such as preparation section, reading section, etc. </li>
       <li>Designed home page, account page, classmates page, seating page, etc.
       <li>Made the navigation bar fixed and considered the situation when partners log in. </li>
       <li>Extracted some of selectors. </li>
       <li>Added "hover" to links as well as "transition" to make links look more delicate. </li>
       </ul>
